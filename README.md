# Higly Customizable Generative Adversarial Network
Impressionism GAN - An impressionism masterpieces generator.

I have created a notebook on a highly customizable GAN, which can adapt and vary its output based on the resolution of the input images.
In addition, I have prepared a presentation showcasing the performance metrics for each configuration, including variations in image resolution and batch size. I have thoroughly analyzed the results to provide a comprehensive overview.
